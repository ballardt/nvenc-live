@timeShiftBufferDepth
[optional]
specifies the duration of the smallest time shifting buffer for any Representation in the MPD that is guaranteed to be available for a Media Presentation with type 'dynamic'. When not present, the value is infinite. This value of the attribute is undefined if the type attribute is equal to ‘static’.

minimumUpdatePeriod
examples: PT5M, P100Y
If a template is valid for a long time, there is no reason at all to update the MPD file.
Just make sure that new content is generated at the expected frequency, and the client should be happy.
The base timestamp must be correct in this case!
