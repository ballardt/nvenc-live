\section{RATS in an Infrastructure} \label{infra}

The main contribution of RATS to the state-of-the-art is the efficient and accessible
tiling of UHD videos on a single computer equipped with a consumer-grade GPU. We circumvent certain limitations of the GPU and are thereby able to generate videos compliant with the advanced tiling scheme of HEVC.

In the demo, we present
a variation of our solution that stitches tiles of various
qualities together before delivery to an end-system.
This is not the only possible approach, and is actually somewhat more complex
than eliminating the stitching component and simply creating distinct video streams for each tile instead.
DASH provides the extension DASH-SRD (spatial relationship description), which
allows a client to access tile streams individually, synchronize them, and make
independent quality choices for each \cite{niamut2016}. Providing the appropriate data and
metadata for this approach is actually a simplification of the one we
demonstrate in this paper.

The remaining infrastructure used to deliver the encoded video via HTTP adaptive streaming is entirely comprised of open-source software, including Nginx\footnote{https://github.com/nginx/nginx}, Kaltura nginx-vod-module\footnote{https://github.com/kaltura/nginx-vod-module} and MediaElement.js\footnote{https://www.mediaelementjs.com}.
