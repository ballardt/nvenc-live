\section{RATS demonstration} \label{infra}

We will demonstrate RATS using a single laptop on the server side with a built-in consumer-grade GPU. We will use stored video and live recording from a directly attached camera. Our demo will focus on the visual differences that are incurred when the number of tiles, as well as the tile pattern of encoding profiles changes.

% We circumvent the limitations of the GPU and are thereby able to generate videos compliant with the advanced tiling scheme of HEVC.
The visitor of the demo will be able to observe the changes on an arbitrary computer using any browser that supports Javascript Media Source Extensions and HEVC decoding.
The infrastructure that is used to deliver the encoded video via HTTP adaptive streaming is comprised of open-source software: Nginx\footnote{https://github.com/nginx/nginx}, Kaltura nginx-vod-module\footnote{https://github.com/kaltura/nginx-vod-module} and MediaElement.js\footnote{https://www.mediaelementjs.com}.

The solution that we present in this demo using MediaElement.js relies on tile stitching before delivery of the video to an end-system.	
This is not the only possible approach, DASH provides the extension DASH-SRD (spatial relationship description), which allows a client to access tile streams individually, synchronize them, and make independent quality choices for each \cite{niamut2016}.
However, existing DASH-SRD players make dynamic adaptation choices internally, whereas it is our goal to fully control tile configurations and demonstrate visual differences between them.
